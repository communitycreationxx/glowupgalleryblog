        <p>Defining what makes a face attractive.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
        <h2>Neoteny</h2>
        <p> The display of youth and beauty are intertwined. Facial characteristics can convey an individual's age, fertility and mate quality, leaving a strong impact on perceived attractiveness. 
            When attractive individuals retain baby-like features in adulthood which symbolises youthfulness, their face can be described as neotenous. 
        </p>
        <img src="babyface.png">
        <p> <br>
            So, what is it that makes him look so youthful despite his age? 
            Is his smooth skin the only factor? What should an individual looking to stay youthful pay attention to in order to avoid any signs of ageing?
        </p>


            <h2><br>Neotenous Features</h2>
   
        <img src="baby.jpg">

            <p> <br> Juvenile features such as a high, rounded forehead, relatively large eyes, a small and short nose, full cheeks and smooth skin gives an appearance that is baby-like. <br>
        </p>    
        <img src="neoteny pretty asian.jpg">
        <p> <br>
            Neotenous features tend to be attractive in adults because they signal youth<!--(Cunningham, 1986; Jones, 1995)-->. 
                <!--Cunningham, M. R. (1986). Measuring the physical in physical attractiveness: Quasi-experiments on the sociobiology of female facial beauty. Journal of personality and social psychology, 50(5), 925.--> 
                <!--Jones, D., Brace, C. L., Jankowiak, W., Laland, K. N., Musselman, L. E., Langlois, J. H., ... & Symons, D. (1995). Sexual selection, physical attractiveness, and facial neoteny: 
                Cross-cultural evidence and implications [and comments and reply]. Current anthropology, 36(5), 723-748.-->
            Youthfulness is often equated with health, vitality and fertility, making neotenous features particularly attractive in potential mates <!--(Jones, 1995; Rhodes, 2006)-->.
            <!--Rhodes, G. (2006). The evolutionary psychology of facial beauty. Annual Review of Psychology, 57(1), 199–226. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190208

            <br><br>Such features are often described as "cute" or "adorable," evoking positive emotional responses<!--(Glocker et al., 2009)-->.
            The "baby schema" effect, where infantile features trigger caregiving behaviors, also extends to adults with neotenous traits, making them more appealing.
            <!--Glocker, M. L., Langleben, D. D., Ruparel, K., Loughead, J. W., Valdez, J. N., Griffin, M. D., ... & Gur, R. C. (2009). Baby schema modulates the brain reward system in nulliparous women. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106(22), 9115–9119.-->
            <br><br>
            Moreover, neotenous features are associated with approachability, making individuals appear more trustworthy and friendly.
            <!--Zebrowitz, L. A., & Montepare, J. M. (2008). Social psychological face perception: Why appearance matters. Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 2(3), 1497–1517. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2008.00109.x-->
        </p>
            <h2>Youth & Health</h2> 

            <p> Features that display youth are not simply controlled by your genes. 
            </p><br>
            <img src="chill facemask.png"><br><br>
            <p> While genetics determine factors such as having larger eyes or a smaller nose, the loss of youthful features can be accelerated by one's lifestyle, even at a young age.
            <br><br> For instance, sleep deprivation can result in droopy eye lids <!--(Sundelin et al., 2013)--> and downturned mouth corners. <!--(Axelsson et al., 2010)-->
            <!--Sundelin, T., Lekander, M., Kecklund, G., Van Someren, E. J., Olsson, A., & Axelsson, J. (2013). Cues of fatigue: Effects of sleep deprivation on facial appearance. Sleep, 36(9), 1355–1360.

            Unprotected UV exposure can creating wrinkles, age spots, and oxidative damage to the skin, accelerating skin ageing.
            <!--Fisher, G. J., Wang, Z. Q., Datta, S. C., Varani, J., Kang, S., & Voorhees, J. J. (1997). Pathophysiology of premature skin aging induced by ultraviolet light. New England Journal of Medicine, 337(20), 1419–1428.

            It is well within one's control to maintain a youthful, attractive appearance, even as one ages.

                <h2><br>Retaining Youthfulness</h2>
                <p> Your lifestyle can impact your perceived age. But cues that signal youth are present throughout the face and it is insufficient to simply focus on a few features. 
                </p>
                <br><img src="youthful skin.jpg"><br><br>
                <p>
                    The presence of wrinkles, puffiness, etc. in the under-eye region highly impact in the perception of age. The eyebrow position and shape changes when your body ages at a quicker pace. 
                    Loss of collagen and elastin in the skin leads to nasolabial folds<!--(Wong et al., 2017)

            <p> Hence, appearing young comes from an improvement of overall health and holistic lifestyle changes. Self care should be multifaceted, ranging from diet to nutrition to skincare.
