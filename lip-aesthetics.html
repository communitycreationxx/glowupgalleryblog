        <h1>What Makes Lips Attractive?</h1>
        <p>Defining what makes a face attractive.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
        <h2>Aesthetic lips</h2>
        <p>Aesthetic lips subtly convey health, youthfulness, and allure, reflecting universal signals of attractiveness. The key lies in achieving balanced proportions that harmonize with the overall facial structure, complementing the natural contours of the face.</p>
        <img src ="newestlip.jpg">
        <h2>Lip Proportions</h2>
            <p> Attractive lips are defined by size and proportion. 
                The absolute size for lips to be attractive should remain within a natural range typical of one’s ethnic group (i.e. should not deviate from normality). <br><br>

                In terms of lip position, an ideal upper-to-lower lip height ratio is found to be 1:2<!-- (Kempta et al., 2023) -->. <br>
                The lower vermillion should also be slightly larger than the upper vermillion, with a ratio of 1:1.3 to 1:1.6<!-- (Farkas, 1994; Rhee et al., 2015)-->. <br> <i>Note: vermillion refers to the red part of the lips</i></p>

                <img src="lips edited.png">
            <p> The ideal fullness of the lips differs across culture and gender. <br><i>Click below to reveal cultural preferences & gender differences.</i>
            </p>
            <div class="reveal-group">
                <input type="checkbox" id="read-more-toggle-1">
                <label for="read-more-toggle-1" class="read-more-btn">Cultural preferences</label>
                <div class="hidden-text">
                    <p>- Caucasians favor the "golden ratio" of 1:1.6, with a noticeably fuller lower lip (Farkas, 1994). <br>
                        - Asians prefer more balanced upper and lower lips, with ratios around 1:1 to 1:1.3 (Farkas et al., 2005). <br>
                        - African populations naturally exhibit fuller lips, favoring ratios between 1:1 and 1:1.2 (Farkas et al., 2005).</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="reveal-group">

                <label for="read-more-toggle-2" class="read-more-btn">Gender differences</label>
                <div class="hidden-text">
                    <p>Women generally have fuller, more prominent lip color (vermilion) compared to the less visible upper lip skin due to higher estrogen<!-- (Farkas, 1981; Fink & Neave, 2005) -->. Fuller, wider lips enhance female attractiveness 
                    <!-- (Farkas et al., 1987) --> by creating a striking, prominent lip appearance and amplifying femininity. Moreover, naturally full lips best signify youth, fertility, and beauty.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> Despite gender differences, pouty, robust lips are perceived as sexually appealing in both men and women<!--(Sarnof & Gotkin, 2012)-->. <br>
                Full, well-defined lips with distinct vermilion borders are universally attractive<!--(Popenko et al., 2017; Heidekrueger et al., 2017)-->, but natural-looking lips are preferred over exaggerated augmentation, 
                as excessively full lips can appear uncanny<!--(Popenko et al., 2017)-->.
            </p>
            <h2><br>Lip Projection</h2>
            <p> How the lips come together at rest affects how you are perceived. Hence, attractive lips are well-projected and well-aligned.
            </p>
            <img src="maxilla instituto c.png">
            <p>The space between the lips at rest ideally ranges from 0 to 3 millimeters. <br>
                If this gap exceeds 4 mm, it indicates an incomplete lip seal, which can detract from aesthetics and hinder function.  <br><br>
                Common causes are protrusive or retrusive lips, which trace back to suboptimal upper jaw (maxillary) development.
                Thus, abnormal lip projection (and sometimes even lip proportions) alludes to the presence of orthodontic issues, 
                making the lips less attractive. <br> <b>Attractive lip projection is a reflection of healthy dentofacial development.</b><br><br>
            </p>
            <div class="reveal-group">
                <input type="checkbox" id="read-more-toggle-4">
                <label for="read-more-toggle-4" class="read-more-btn">Additional details</label>
                <div class="hidden-text">
                <p> Certain oral habits like thumb-sucking or tongue-thrusting can alter the development of the dental arches, leading to lip protrusion over time (Bishara, 1998). 
                        Improper development of the underlying skeletal structure (i.e. dentofacial growth) often affects a myriad of important aesthetic facial features, with the lips being one of them.

                <p> Different ethnicities are also predisposed to have different degrees of lip protrusion. Thus, lip prominence is not only evaluated with respect to the chin, nose and overall facial profile, 
                    but also compared with population means and attractive ranges within the same ethnic group.

                <h3>Cupid's Bow</h3>
                <p> 
                    The presence of a Cupid's bow or lack thereof highlights how youthful one is. With the lips flattening and its distinct Cupid's bow shape being lost with age, a well-defined cupid signals youth<!--(Wollina, 2013)-->. <br><br>
                    A visually pleasing Cupid's bow should slant upwards from the mouth corners to the Cupid's peak gently at an angle between 10-20°<!--(Wollina, 2013)-->.

                <h3> Lip Shapes - A Cosmetic Guide
                </h3>
                <p>Different lip shapes evoke different impressions—some exude sensuality, while others enhance a youthful or elegant appearance. 
                    Heart-shaped lips allude to playfulness and charm; fuller lips create a pouty look, enhancing sensuality and youthfulness whereas narrower lips contribute to a more delicate and refined appearance. 
                    <br><br> Aesthetic clinics suggests that fuller lips pair well with longer faces and wide lips with wide faces. Moreover, wide lips tend to add structure and enhance expressiveness, with positive assoctions to perceived confidence and charisma. 
                    Perceptions of a broad smile tend to be more attractive than a narrow one<!--(Profitt et al., 2013)-->.
                
                <br><br>The shape of the lips adds finesse to the lips' appearance but is secondary to lip position and projection for attractiveness.

                <h2><br>The Philtrum</h2> 
                <img src="phrssb.png">
                <p> <br>The philtrum—the area between the nose and the upper lip—can add definition, create a youthful appearance and enhance symmetry when it has clear, prominent ridges <!--(Nunes & Bran, 2021)-->.</p>
                    

                <p>While a well-defined philtrum is often associated with traditional beauty standards, the absence of pronounced ridges is not inherently unattractive.
                Instead, a philtrum acts as a subtle accent, but its natural variation highlights the unique beauty of every face.
                </p>
                <h2><br>Lip Colour</h2>
                <p> Natural lip colour varies across ethnic and geographic regions and today's beauty market is saturated with lipstick shades to suit diverse skin tones and ethnicities. 
                    Yet, the main consumers are mostly women. Does this mean lip colour only affects female attractiveness? <br><br>
                </p>

                            <h3> <br> Lip Colour, Contrast & Health  </h3>

                <p>
                    For men, lip color is an important visual cue for health, vitality, and genetic fitness. Healthy, unchapped lips with a pinkish tone tends to be attractive. </p>

                    <div class="reveal-group">
                        <input type="checkbox" id="read-more-toggle-5">
                        <label for="read-more-toggle-5" class="read-more-btn">Additional details</label>
                        <div class="hidden-text">
                        <p>
                    Lips with a healthy reddish or pinkish tone are often perceived as a sign of good blood circulation and overall health. Pale lips may signal anemia or illness, while overly dark lips 
                    can sometimes be associated with dehydration or smoking-related effects (Stephen et al., 2009). 
                    From an evolutionary perspective, subtle redness in lips may signal youthfulness and vitality, traits that are associated with reproductive fitness. 
                    This healthy 'subtle reddish' undertones might appear as darker shades of brown, plum, or reddish-brown rather than a pale pink or red for those with darker lips (Stephen et al., 2009) 
                </p></div>
                    <p>
                    Excessively bright red lips, however, deviate from cultural norms of "natural" male attractiveness<!--(Etcoff, 1999)-->.
                    Increased luminance contrast between the facial features (lips and eyes) and the skin serves to reduce masculinity and attractiveness of male faces whereas it enhances the youthfulness, 
                    femininity and attractiveness of female faces<!--(Stephen & McKeegan, 2010)-->.

                            <h3> Lip Shades </h3>

                <p> Red lips in women enhance attractiveness, possibly because they mimic vasodilation associated with sexual arousal<!--(Bullivant et al., 2004; Roberts et al., 2004; Lynn et al., 2007)-->.
                    When lipsticks are used to achieve this effect, it is not so much the particular shade of red that matters, but rather the facial contrast created without overwhelming the skin complexion. </p>

                    Soft pinks, coral shades, and light peach complement fair skin (Tomas-Roca et al., 2018); Rose, mauve and medium reds best highlight the natural depth of medium skin tones; 
                    Deeper shades of red enhance the richness of dark skin for a bold
                    contrast, giving a vibrant, defined look (van der Meij & van der Laan, 2008).

            <p>
                The lips are a health indicator—pointing to orthodontic problems that can be improved on, as well as reflecting health. Facial attractiveness is strongly correlated to health, 
                and lifestyle improvements are nothing short of transformative! <br> <i>Learn More under the How to Glow Up section</i></p>
