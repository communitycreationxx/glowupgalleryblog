        <h1>Symmetry</h1>
        <p>Defining what makes a face attractive.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
        <h2>Symmetry</h2>
        <p> You’ve likely heard that a highly symmetrical face is attractive.<br> While symmetry alone does not imply attractiveness, it is still pertinent to uncover the role of symmetry in beauty.
        </p>
        <img src="asian symmetry.png">
        <p> <br>Symmetry means that the left and right sides of something, like a face, are nearly identical. 
            Increasing facial symmetry increases facial attractiveness even if facial features remain the same<!--Little, A. C., & Jones, B. C. (2006). 
            Attraction independent of detection suggests special mechanisms for symmetry preferences in human face perception. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273(1605), 3093–3099.-->.
            This preference is thought to be evolutionary, as symmetry may signal good health and genetic quality<!--Rhodes, G., Proffitt, F., Grady, J. M., & Sumich, A. (1998). 
            Facial symmetry and the perception of beauty. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 5(4), 659-669.-->. 
        </p>
        <img src="symmetry.png">
        <p> <br>
            Models, particularly those in high-fashion or beauty industries, are often selected based on their facial symmetry<!--Fink, B., Neave, N., Manning, J. T., & Grammer, K. (2006). 
            Facial symmetry and judgements of attractiveness, health and personality. Personality and Individual Differences, 41(3), 491-499. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2006.01.017

            <p> 
                In nature, animals and humans that grow up healthy tend to develop more symmetrical features. <br> Thus, we find such features more attractive.
                In contrast, asymmetry in humans increases with inbreeding, psychosis and premature birth, and in turn negatively affects facial beauty. <!--The Evolutionary Psychology of Facial Beauty. Rhodes G. Annu Rev Psychol. 2006;57:199-226. Review.-->

            <p> The images on the top row show the original faces whereas those on the bottom show the version where symmetry is enhanced. 
                    Participants of the study rated the faces on the bottom row as more attractive.

            <h2><br>Visual appeal</h2>
            <p> When you see a face that’s symmetrical, your brain finds it easier to process and more pleasing to look at. It’s like looking at a neatly arranged bookshelf compared to a messy one—our brains just enjoy order! <br>
                Symmetry activates areas of the brain associated with reward and aesthetic appreciation.
                <!--Jacobsen, T., & Höfel, L. (2003). Descriptive and evaluative judgment processes:
                Behavioral and electrophysiological indices of processing symmetry and aesthetics. Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience, 3(4), 289–299. https://doi.org/10.3758/CABN.3.4.289-->
            </p>
            <br><br><img src="center part.jpg"><br>
            <p>  Symmetrical faces are processed more quickly and effortlessly by the brain, a phenomenon known as cognitive fluency. This ease of processing is inherently pleasurable, which is why symmetrical faces are often perceived as more attractive.
             <!--Reber, R., Schwarz, N., & Winkielman, P. (2004). Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience? Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8(4), 
             364–382. https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0804_3-->
            <br><br>Facial proportions and facial symmetry are separate yet interrelated entities
            Proportion is the balance between the sizes of different parts and their relationship to the whole. Symmetry arises from this balance because equal and harmonious proportions create a mirrored, 
            pleasing appearance. 
        </p>
        <img src="face template.jpg">
        <p>
            Without proportion and symmetry, a human face lacks harmony and seems unbalanced in a less aesthetically pleasing way.
            </p>
            <h2>Asymmetry</h2> 
            <p> While symmetry is associated with beauty, it is also important to distinguish the types of asymmetry as the different kinds have varying impacts on beauty.
                It is frequently cited that small asymmetries can make the face unique and more attractive, because it makes the face more human. <br><br>
                After all, no face is perfectly symmetrical. 
            </p>
            <br><img src="brow slit.jpg"><br><br>
            <p> In short, symmetry mainly enhances attractiveness when it displays health cues.
                Just like how a well-lined eyebrow slit does not detract from facial aesthetics, certain asymmetric features enhances individuality. <br><br>

               In more technical terms, asymmetry can be classfied as fluctuating asymmetry and directional asymmetry, in which they have differing impacts on facial beauty.   
            </p>
            <div class="reveal-group">
                <input type="checkbox" id="read-more-toggle-2">
                <label for="read-more-toggle-2" class="read-more-btn">Fluctuating vs Directional Asymmetry</label>
                <div class="hidden-text">
                    <p>
                    Fluctuating asymmetry refers to small, random deviations from perfect symmetry in a face or body and are thought to arise from developmental instability, environmental stressors, or genetic factors during growth.
                    <br><br>
                    Directional asymmetry refers to systematic deviations from symmetry that are consistently biased to one side, such
                    right-side dominance in facial features. Studies have shown that the right side of the face is often slightly larger or more pronounced than the left side in many individuals. 
                    This is a systematic, consistent pattern of asymmetry across the population. <br><br>
     
                    Unlike fluctuating asymmetry, directional asymmetry in the face is generally not perceived as unattractive because it is a predictable and consistent pattern<!--Vig, P. S., & Hewitt, A. B. (1975). Asymmetry of the human facial skeleton. 
                    The Angle Orthodontist, 45(2), 125–129. https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1975)045<0125:AOTHFS >2.0.CO;2--> and does not signal poor health or genetic quality<!--
                    Thornhill, R., & Gangestad, S. W. (1999). Facial attractiveness. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 3(12), 452–460. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01403-5-->.
                    
                    In fact, it may contribute to the uniqueness and character of a person’s face, which can enhance attractiveness<!--
                    Perrett, D. I., Burt, D. M., Penton-Voak, I. S., Lee, K. J., Rowland, D. A., & Edwards, R. (1999). Symmetry and human facial attractiveness. Evolution and Human Behavior, 20(5), 295–307. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1090-5138(99)00014-8-->
                    by making a face more memorable or distinctive without detracting from overall beauty.

            </div>

                <h2><br>Where Symmetry Matters</h2>
                <p> Certain regions of the face are more prone to asymmetry than others. Naturally, symmetry has a more profound impact on certain regions when determining facial beauty. <br><br> 
                </p>
                <img src="regional symmetry.png"><br>
                <p> The likelihood of asymmetry in each region can be illustrated from the above visual. <br>
                    Research shows that asymmetry tends to be the most common and of greatest extent in the jaw and least in the cranium as the jaw is subject to the most external forces (i.e. chewing) during development. 
                    <br><br>
                    Symmetry is most salient in the eyes, followed by nose, then lips. Symmetry in these central features matter more in perceptions of attractiveness compared to peripheral features such as the ears.
                </p>

                    <div class="hidden-text">
                    <p>
                        The eye region (including eyebrows) is the most critical region for facial symmetry as it forms the central prominence of the face. 
                        Uneven positioning, shape, or size of the eyes is highly noticeable and significantly impacts facial attractiveness and symmetry perception. (Rhodes, 2006).
                        <!-- Rhodes, G. (2006). The evolutionary psychology of facial beauty. Annual Review of Psychology, 57(1), 199–226. -->
                        <br><br>
                        Next, symmetry in the nose is particularly important because it anchors the midface and influences the perception of overall facial balance.
                        <!--Farkas, L. G. (1987). Anthropometry of the head and face in medicine. Elsevier.-->
                        <br><br>
                        The mouth is another key feature for symmetry, particularly the alignment of the lips and the philtrum (the groove between the nose and upper lip).
                        <!--Perrett, D. I., Burt, D. M., Penton-Voak, I. S., Lee, K. J., Rowland, D. A., & Edwards, R. (1999). Symmetry and human facial attractiveness. Evolution and Human Behavior, 20(5), 295–307.-->
                        The jawline and chin defines the lower face. A deviated chin or uneven jawline, can lead to an unbalanced appearance <!--Farkas, L. G. (1987). Anthropometry of the head and face in medicine. Elsevier.-->.

                </div>
                <p>Asymmetry detracts from facial aesthetics mainly when it becomes apparent and signals abnormalities.</p>
                <h2><br>Is it possible to fix asymmetry?</h2>
                <img src="bone asymmetry.png">
                <p> The underlying bone structure and the facial muscles work together to create the final facial form. Hence, they determine facial symmetry. 
                    Moreover, the head is aligned with the rest of the muscles such as the spine and neck muscles, such that asymmetry in these regions beyond the head can impact facial symmetry.
                </p>
                <img src="asymmetry align.jpg">
                <p> Asymmetry can be present throughout the body, reaching the face and impacting aesthetics. <br>

                    <br><img src="bradley.png"><br><br>
                <p> As conventionally handsome as Bradley Cooper is, his face presents a commonly found asymmetrical pattern -
                    a more flared out ear, lower positioned eye and slightly deviated jaw on one side - which can be attributed to the underlying facial bones. </p>
                    <img src="jaw symmetry.png"><br><br>
                <p> The above shows the likely facial bone structure for this pattern of asymmetry.
                    The sphenoid bone is directly behind the upper jaw (maxilla), whereas the temporal bones are akin to hinges for the lower jaw (mandible), and the development of these facial bones
                    determine facial symmetry. </p>

                <h2><br>Causes</h2>
                <p> Most concerns regarding asymmetry are over developmental asymmetry. Genetic factors are often times beyond our control, but postural reasons are significant yet frequently overlooked. </p>
                    <img src="asymmetric spine.png">
                    <p> Orthodontics have found substantial postural impacts on facial symmetry.
                    Poor posture where the pelvis is misaligned can affect the entire body, including the face, due to compensatory mechanisms in the spine and neck. <!--
                    Kendall, F. P., McCreary, E. K., & Provance, P. G. (2005). Muscles: Testing and function with posture and pain (5th ed.). Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.-->
                    There is significant correlation between cervical spine posture and craniofacial morphology, particularly in individuals with asymmetrical mandibular growth patterns.
                    <!--Sonnesen, L., Bakke, M., & Solow, B. (2001). Temporomandibular disorders in relation to craniofacial dimensions, head posture and bite force in children selected for orthodontic treatment.

                <br><img src="tongue.jpg"><br><br>
                    <p>
                    Tongue posture (i.e. unbalanced mewing) can cause uneven forces to be applied on the upper jaw, influencing maxillary development. Often, individuals notice their good side
                    - the side with a better side profile. 
                </p>
                <img src="back muscles.jpg"><br>
                <p> Unideal posture (e.g. more significant forward head posture on one side), coupled with muscle imbalances in the neck and back can hinder the tongue's ability to press evenly on the roof of the mouth, especially during swallowing.
                    Given that swallowing is performed from 600-1000 times a day, the maxilla is subject to much force from the tongue.

                    </p>
                <h2>Fixes</h2>
                <p> While genetic factors may be beyond one's control, optimising one's posture can benefit health and facial symmetry. 
                    It is crucial to first fix underlying postural problems.
                </p><img src="stretch.png">
                <p> Back and neck exercises, maintaining proper posture throughout the day, myofunctional therapy, or even seeking qualified orthodontists for advice may seem like small steps, but they go a long way.

                <p>
                Nevertheless, no face is perfectly symmetrical. Obessing over minor asymmetries is futile, since it is fine as long as they are not blatantly noticable. What an individual can do 
                is maintain a healthy posture to facilitate proper, symmetrical facial development.</p>
